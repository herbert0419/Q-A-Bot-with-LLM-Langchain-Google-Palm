              "'### The importance of statistics in Data Science\\n\\nStatistics is a branch of mathematics that deals with the collection, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data. It is used to make inferences about the population from a sample, to test hypotheses, and to develop models. In Data Science, statistics is used to:\\n\\n* **Clean and prepare data**. Before data can be analyzed, it must be cleaned and prepared. This involves removing duplicate data points, dealing with missing values, and identifying outliers. Statistics can be used to identify patterns in the data that can be used to improve the cleaning process.\\n* **Explore and visualize data**. Once the data has been cleaned and prepared, it can be explored and visualized. This helps to identify trends and patterns in the data that can be used to develop models. Statistics can be used to create visualizations that make it easier to identify patterns in the data.\\n* **Develop models**. Once trends and patterns have been identified, models can be developed to predict future outcomes. Statistics can be used to select the best model for the data and to evaluate the performance of the model.\\n* **Make inferences**. Once a model has been developed, it can be used to make inferences about the population. Statistics can be used to determine the accuracy of the inferences and to identify the limitations of the model.\\n\\nStatistics is a critical tool for Data Science. It is used at every stage of the data science process, from cleaning and preparing data to developing and evaluating models. By understanding statistics, Data Scientists can make better decisions about how to use data to solve real-world problems.\\n\\n### Some specific examples of how statistics is used in Data Science include:\\n\\n* **In natural language processing (NLP), statistics is used to identify the parts of speech in a sentence, to determine the sentiment of a text, and to generate text.**\\n* **In computer vision, statistics is used to identify objects in an image, to track objects over time, and to generate images.**\\n* **In recommender systems, statistics is used to predict the items that a user will like, to rank items, and to personalize recommendations.**\\n* **In fraud detection, statistics is used to identify fraudulent transactions, to prevent fraud, and to recover from fraud.**\\n\\nStatistics is a powerful tool that can be used to solve a wide variety of problems. By understanding statistics, Data Scientists can make better decisions about how to use data to solve real-world problems.'"

We envision a prosperous \\nand inclusive India, in which the fruits of development reach all regions and \\ncitizens, especially our youth, women, farmers, OBCs, Scheduled Castes and \\nScheduled Tribes.  \\n2. In the 75th year of our Independence, the world has recognised the \\nIndian economy as a ‘bright star’. Our current year’s economic growth is \\nestimated to be at 7 per cent. It is notable that this is the highest among all \\nthe major economies. This is in spite of the massive slowdown globally \\ncaused by Covid-19 and a war. The Indian economy is therefore on the right \\ntrack, and despite a time of challenges, heading towards a bright future.  \\n3. Today as Indians stands with their head held high, and the world \\nappreciates India’s achievements and successes, we are sure that elders \\nwho had fought for India’s independence, will with joy, bless us our \\nendeavors going forward. \\nResilience amidst multiple crises \\n4.

During the Covid-19 pandemic, we ensured that no one goes to bed \\nhungry, with a scheme to supply free food grains to over 80 crore persons \\nfor 28 months. Continuing our commitment to ensure food and nutritional \\nsecurity, we are implementing, from 1st January 2023, a scheme to supply \\nfree food grain to all Antyodaya and priority households for the next one \\nyear, under PM Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY). The entire \\nexpenditure of about ` 2 lakh crore will be borne by the Central \\nGovernment. \\nG20 Presidency: Steering the global agenda through challenges \\n6. In these times of global challenges, the G20 Presidency gives us a \\nunique opportunity to strengthen India’s role in the world economic order. \\nWith the theme of ‘ Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’ , we are steering an \\nambitious, people-centric agenda to address global challenges, and to \\nfacilitate sustainable economic development.  \\nAchievements since 2014: Leaving no one behind \\n7. The government’s efforts since 2014 have ensured for all citizens a \\nbetter quality of living and a life of dignity. The per capita income has more \\nthan doubled to ` 1.97 lakh.   \\n8. In these nine years, the Indian economy has increased in size from \\nbeing 10th to 5th largest in the world.

I \\nhave five major announcements to make in this regard. These primarily \\nbenefit our hard-working middle class. \\n146. The first one concerns rebate. Currently, those with income up to  \\n` 5 lakh do not pay any income tax in both old and new tax regimes. I \\npropose to increase the rebate limit to ` 7 lakh in the new tax regime. Thus, \\npersons in the new tax regime, with income up to ` 7 lakh will not have to \\npay any tax.  \\n147. The second proposal relates to middle-class individuals. \\n I had introduced, in the year 2020, the new personal income tax regime \\nwith six income slabs starting from ` 2.5 lakh. I propose to change the tax \\nstructure in this regime by reducing the number of slabs to five and \\nincreasing the tax exemption limit to ` 3 lakh. The new tax rates are: \\n` 0-3 lakh Nil \\n` 3-6 lakh 5 per cent \\n` 6-9 lakh 10 per cent \\n` 9-12 lakh 15 per cent \\n` 12-15 lakh 20 per cent \\nAbove ` 15 lakh 30 per cent \\n \\n148. This will provide major relief to all tax payers in the new regime. An \\nindividual with an annual income of ` 9 lakh will be required to pay only  \\n` 45,000/-. This is only 5 per cent of his or her income. It is a reduction of 25 \\nper cent on what he or she is required to pay now, ie, ` 60,000/-. Similarly, \\nan individual with an income of ` 15 lakh would be required to pay only  \\n` 1.5 lakh or 10 per cent of his or her income, a reduction of 20 per cent \\nfrom the existing liability of ` 1,87,500/.  \\n149.

My fourth announcement in personal income tax is regarding the \\nhighest tax rate which in our country is 42.74 per cent. This is among the \\nhighest in the world. I propose to reduce the highest surcharge rate from 37 \\nper cent to 25 per cent in the new tax regime. This would result in reduction \\nof the maximum tax rate to 39 per cent. \\n151.

Whereas, before 2014, \\nthere were only 26…”  Local communities have always been at the forefront \\nof conservation efforts. The government will promote their unique \\nconservation values through Amrit Dharohar , a scheme that will be \\nimplemented over the next three years to encourage optimal use of \\nwetlands, and enhance bio-diversity, carbon stock,  \\neco-tourism opportunities and income generation for local communities.  \\nCoastal Shipping \\n87. Coastal shipping will be promoted as the energy efficient and lower \\ncost mode of transport, both for passengers and freight, through PPP mode \\nwith viability gap funding.   \\nVehicle Replacement \\n88. Replacing old polluting vehicles is an important part of greening our \\neconomy. In furtherance of the vehicle scrapping policy mentioned in \\nBudget 2021-22, I have allocated adequate funds to scrap old vehicles of ', metadata={'source': 'budget_speech.pdf', 'page': 22})]}"
